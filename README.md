A wheel spin game is a game of chance where players spin a virtual or physical wheel divided into different sections, each representing a potential prize, action, or outcome. The wheel typically contains various rewards, penalties, or random events, making it exciting and unpredictable.
This type of game is commonly used in promotions, giveaways, and decision-making mechanics in apps and games. The thrill comes from the uncertainty of where the wheel will stop, creating an engaging experience for users.
